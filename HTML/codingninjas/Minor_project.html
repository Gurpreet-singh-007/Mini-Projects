                <h1>Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming</h1>
                <p>Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also governed by informal rules. Most of these rules are formulated over decades. Programming languahes often remain in usage for longer than their founders expect . </p>
                <p>Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for diggerent purposes . Thus some static do's and don'ts are always of use in the fluid zone called coding . Normally , a great code has three common features : maintainability , dependability , and usabilty .It should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even in changing environments .However,before coding even begin , a few prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to provider a solid foundation on which readable code can be written .

                <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
                <p>This is easily the most important step of all .In order of these , a coder may be inefficient even if it is completed . The prerequisites that need to be in place for an efficient code covers matters like design and architecture .An important question is how development is structured .What is the specific purpose of the sortware ? The problem that the code is meant to solve mustbe clear to the developer .What is the design of the individual components? Such basic requirements have to fulfilled when good code is being written .</p>
                <p>
                    Once these are met ,easier to follow some established good coding pratices.

                            <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
                        <p>
                        Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially  
                        for codes that are written by multiple programmers. However, comments reduce 
                        the cost of knowledge  transfer.

                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                                <h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
                        <p>
                        Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often developers 
                        use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not replace them with meaningful names.
                        </p> 
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                            <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
                        <p>
                        Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The installation files should 
                        be kept to a minimum and updated regularly.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                    
                <p>
                The best practices for coding are, most of all, designed to reduce risk whenever there are chances of it. For a beginner, a few of these will not be completely applicable.
